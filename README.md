`rsgem` is a tool to help you start developing gems with the defaults we use at Rootstrap.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rsgem

We highly suggest to not include `rsgem` in your Gemfile.
`rsgem` is not a library, and should not affect the dependency tree of your application.

## Usage

_TODO_

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
